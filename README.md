# graduationDesign
for my 2020 graduation

the project's target is to make a system based on binocular camera, whose function is to measure the materials' length 
or other physical size.

first i should calibrate the camera, then i develop it from pattern analysis and 3d construction during which i produce some
interfaces and strengthen its functionalities.
